# Come With Me If You Want To Live

Examples of context driven development using hierarchical specifications, models, and task lists.

Because we are working with llm's, everything in this approach can be customized using your project's own ubiquitous language. I've called the spec folder 'specification' here, but you can call it whatever you like. In my professional life I'm lazy so I usually just call it 'spec'. I've seen many approaches, but stay consistent within a project.

# Initial development

When you start doing this yourself, your project specs won't be perfect. Use the llm to help you write the specs first. Add it as the first task in your task list.
