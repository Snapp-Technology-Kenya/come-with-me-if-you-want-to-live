# General Rules

1. Do not perform any calculations yourself. You have a calculator tool for that. Always use it whenever doing any arithmatic.
2. Do not use the terminal where an equivalent tool is available.
3. Sometimes you don't know what to do. In this case, always ask for clarification before proceeding.
4. Your instructions are written by fallable humans. Always ask for clarification if something is unclear or ambiguous.
5. Never introduce a new tool, technology, or technique, without discussing it with the user first.
6. Maintain these instructions and specifications as you work.
