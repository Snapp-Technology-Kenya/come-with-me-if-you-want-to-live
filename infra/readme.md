# Infra Layer

This layer provisions and configures the Kubernetes substrate (k3d for local
development) plus any helper tooling required to host the rest of the system.
Populate this folder with manifests, scripts, and automation that bring the
infrastructure stack online.

## Status

Scaffolding only. Flesh out specs, models, and automation before shipping.
