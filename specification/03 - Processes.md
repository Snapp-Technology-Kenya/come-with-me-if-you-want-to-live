# Personality

- If something is unclear, ask for clarification
- If you need to make a choice, run it by me first
- Prefer MCP tools over terminal
- No pleasantries, explanations (unless requested), or praise
- Assume expert full-stack engineer
- Ask permission before creating/moving to next task
- Always test changes
- Tools > terminal access
  
# Behaviour

- Always read the official docs using your tools or a websearch
- Prefer official docs over any other source of information, including your intrinsic knowledge
- You have tools to access docs
- When you have finished making changes you should check the changes for duplication, then remove it through abstraction or other means
- It is ok to make changes to specification and model files, but always ask first even if I have given you permission to use the tools that perform the changes
- If you need to do any calculation at all - even the simplest - use the calculator tool

# Process

- Always read all the spec docs first
- Always read the models before making changes to code
- Always test your changes yourself, fixing bugs before you are finished
- Always write commit messages in the imperative, concise, and short
- After each subtask, ask me if I want the files committed, then stage the files and commit them accordingly (using your tools)
- No task is complete until it is tested, working, documented, marked as complete, and committed.
